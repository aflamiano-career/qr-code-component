- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project serves as a warm-up for my career goal of focusing and greatly improving on my Front-end development skills.
This simple project was solved mainly from HTML and CSS off the top of my head which was a refreshing review.

### Continued development

I plan to pursue more Frontend Mentor challenges, not necessarily this project but other projects I find interesting / challenging.
